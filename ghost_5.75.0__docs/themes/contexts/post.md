Use: `{{#is "post"}}{{/is}}` to detect this context

Whenever you’re viewing a single site post, you’re in the `post` context. The `post` context is not set on static pages, which uses the page context instead.

Routes
------

The URL used to render a single post is configurable in the Ghost admin. The default is `/:slug/`. Ghost also has an option for date-based permalinks, and can support many other formats using [routing](/docs/themes/routing/).

Templates
---------

The default template for a post is `post.hbs`, which is a required template in all Ghost themes.

To provide a custom template for a specific post, use `post-:slug.hbs` as the template name, with `:slug` matching the post’s slug.

For example, if you have a ‘1.0 Announcement’ post with the url /1-0-announcement/, adding a template called `post-1-0-announcement.hbs` will cause that template to be used for the announcement post, instead of `post.hbs`.

Another option is to use a “global” custom post template. If you add a template to your theme called `custom-gallery.hbs` it will be available in a dropdown in the post settings menu so that it can be selected in any post or page.

These templates exist in a hierarchy. Ghost looks for a template which matches the slug (`post-:slug.hbs`) first, then looks for a custom template (`custom-gallery.hbs` if selected in the post settings) and finally uses `post.hbs` if no slug-specific template exists and no custom template is specified.

Data
----

The `post` context provides access to the post object which matches the route. As with all contexts, all of the `@site` global data is also available.

When outputting the post, use a block expression (`{{#post}}{{/post}}`) to drop into the post scope and access all of the attributes.

### Post object attributes

* **id** — the Object ID of the post
* **comment\_id** — The old, pre-1.0 incremental id of a post if present, or else the new Object ID
* **title** — the title of your site post
* **slug** — slugified version of the title (used in urls and also useful for class names)
* **excerpt** — a short preview of your post content
* **content** — the content of the post
* **url** — the web address for the post page (see url helper) and special attributes
* **feature\_image** — the cover image associated with the post
* **feature\_image\_alt** — alt text for the cover image associated with the post
* **feature\_image\_caption** — caption for the cover image associated with the post (supports basic html)
* **featured** — indicates a featured post. Defaults to `false`
* **page** — `true` if the post is a page. Defaults to `false`
* **meta\_title** — custom meta title for the post
* **meta\_description** — custom meta description for the post
* **published\_at** — date and time when the post was published
* **updated\_at** — date and time when the post was last updated
* **created\_at** — date and time when the post was created
* **primary\_author** — a formatted link to the first author
* **tags** — a list of tags associated with the post
* **primary\_tag** — direct reference to the first tag associated with the post

Helpers
-------

The `{{#post}}{{/post}}` block expression is used to theme the post template. Once inside of the post, you can use any of these useful helpers (and many more) to output your post’s data:

`{{title}}`, `{{content}}`, `{{url}}`, `{{author}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{excerpt}}`, `{{img_url}}`, `{{post_class}}`, `{{tags}}`.

```
<!-- post.hbs -->
<!-- Everything inside the #post tags pulls data from the post -->
{{#post}}
<article class="{{post_class}}">
  <header class="post-header">
    <h1 class="post-title">{{title}}</h1>
    <section class="post-meta">
      <time class="post-date" datetime="{{date format='YYYY-MM-DD'}}">
        {{date format="DD MMMM YYYY"}}
      </time>
      {{tags prefix=" on "}}
    </section>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content">
    {{content}}
  </section>
</article>
{{/post}}

```

Special attributes
------------------

The post model is the most complex model in Ghost, and it has special attributes, which are calculated by the API.

### URL

URL is a calculated, created based on the site’s permalink setting and the post’s other properties. It exists as a data attribute, but should always be output using the special `{{url}}` helper rather than referenced as a data attribute.

Always open a context and use `{{url}}` explicitly for *all* resources, especially in posts. For example, use `{{#post}}{{url}}{{/post}}` instead of `{{post.url}}`.

### Primary tag

Each post has a list of 0 or more tags associated with it, which is accessed via the `tags` property and `{{tags}}` helper. The first tag in the list is considered more important, and can be accessed using a `primary_tag` calculated property. This is a path expression, which points to a whole tag object, rather than a helper function.
